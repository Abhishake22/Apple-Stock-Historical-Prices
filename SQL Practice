1.Retreive all Rows:

SELECT * FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price

2.Count all rows

select COUNT(*)
from tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price

3. Write a query to count the number of non-null rows in the low column.

SELECT COUNT(low) AS low
FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price


4. #Write a query that determines counts of every single column. With these counts, can you tell which column has the most null values?
 
 SELECT COUNT(year) AS year,
       COUNT(month) AS month,
       COUNT(open) AS open,
       COUNT(high) AS high,
       COUNT(low) AS low,
       COUNT(close) AS close,
       COUNT(volume) AS volume
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
  
  
 5. The query below selects the sum of the volume column from the Apple stock prices dataset:

SELECT SUM(volume)
FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price


6. Write a query to calculate the average opening price (hint: you will need to use both COUNT and SUM, as well as some simple arithmetic.).


SELECT SUM(open)/COUNT(open) AS avg_open_price
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
